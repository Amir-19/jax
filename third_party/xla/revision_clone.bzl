# To update XLA to a new revision,
# a) update XLA_COMMIT to the new git commit hash
# b) get the sha256 hash of the commit by running:
#    curl -L https://api.github.com/repos/openxla/xla/tarball/{git_hash} | sha256sum
#    and update XLA_SHA256 with the result.
# Note: This is a clone of revision.bzl for testing the new automation for updating XLA in JAX.
